# XEmbed Eclipse Plugin

This plugin adds a new view named _XEmbedView_ for embedding an external window.

When the `xembed_window_id` dynamic variable is read from a launch configuration,
it opens the XEmbedView view, creates a composite, and returns its window ID (hex value).

See the [feature](https://github.com/GreenSocs/XEmbedFeature) to package and import the plugin into your workspace.
